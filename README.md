# A Dystopian Wars 4.0 repository for use with New Recruit! 

## As of 24/10/25 catalogues are currently updated to the following:
- Alliance Orbat v3
- Commonwealth Orbat v3
- Crown Orbat v3
- Empire Orbat v3
- Enlightened Orbat v3
- Imperium Orbat v3
- Sultanate Orbat v3
- Union Orbat v3
- Rules Glossary v3

## Planned updates:
- [x] Crown Guardian Generator Pool total
- [ ] Make it so it will warn you about taking more Specialist fleets than Main fleets
- [ ] Mercenary access across all orbats. That will be a long off project as im still not sure the best way to implement it yet!  

As per usual if you can let me know if you spot anything wrong, it would be highly appreicated. 
You can do this by either telling me directly on my thread in the Warcradle [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/764059770876592150/1429135310452822129), or by using the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Riandro/Dystopian-Wars/issues)!
